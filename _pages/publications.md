"Racial Differences in Consumption and Saving Behavior: New Survey Evidence and Quantitative Theory of Status Signaling" [Link](http://ainapuig.github.io/files/papers/Paper_MPC_Race_AinaPuig.pdf){:target="_blank"}

The racial wealth gap is large. An explanation for the persistence of this gap is that people spend their resources differently. Estimating the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) by race is crucial in understanding the wealth gap. I draw on survey data I collected to estimate MPCs by race. MPCs are considerably higher among black than white respondents, even after adjusting for characteristics such as age, education, and income. In the Consumer Expenditure Survey, black households consume a higher share of visible goods out of overall consumption to signal status than white households. However, black consumers have more of a need to signal status to compensate for perceptions of them having lower incomes. To match these facts, I introduce status compensation motives into a standard life-cycle model and show that this mechanism can account for 36% of the racial difference in MPCs. Models that include racial heterogeneity in earnings volatility, unemployment shocks, and expenses, but exclude status motives, do not match the data showing that black people’s spending on visible goods increases with wealth. I use my model to show how understanding status spending motives can be used to address the racial wealth gap by estimating the size of a new policy to eliminate racial differences in wealth.

This paper estimates the causal effects of monetary policy shocks on household consumption, with additional analysis of labor market and income responses, disaggregated by gender and race. I find that contractionary monetary policy reduces consumption more for black than white households, with the largest declines among households headed by black women. These gaps persist after accounting for differences in household education, debt, and income, but are partly explained by differences in marital status and spousal insurance against shocks. These shocks also lead households to shift expenditures from non-essential and durable goods toward essential non-durable goods and services. The analysis provides estimates of marginal propensities to consume across groups and shows that contractionary, rather than expansionary, shocks drive aggregate consumption responses. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for intersectional demographic heterogeneity in evaluating the distributional effects of monetary policy.

"Unpaid Elderly Care Work and Women’s Labor Force Participation: The Case of South Korea," with Selin Seçil Akın, Sung Ah Bahk, Lídia Brun, Ignacio González

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
This study investigates the impact of Korea's universal long-term care insurance (LTCI) system, implemented in 2008, on the labor market outcomes of family caregivers. We exploit multiple discontinuities in LTCI benefits to estimate their effect on caregivers' employment. Analyzing data from a nationally representative survey, we find a significant increase in labor force participation among women attributable to LTCI benefits, while no corresponding effect is observed for men. Additionally, the benefits reduce the likelihood of women engaging in family caregiving as their primary activity, underscoring the gender-differentiated impact of Korea's LTCI. These findings highlight the crucial role of LTC policies in shaping labor market outcomes for caregivers, with notable implications for female labor supply dynamics.
