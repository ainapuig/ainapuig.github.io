Hi! I'm a fourth year PhD student in economics at American University. My research interests are in macroeconomics and inequality topics. I have worked on projects studying the distributional effects of monetary policy while visiting the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and the International Monetary Fund.
