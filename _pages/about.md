Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in economics at American University, visiting the University of Pennsylvania for Spring 2024. My research interests are in macroeconomics and inequality topics. I have worked on projects studying the distributional effects of monetary policy while visiting the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and the International Monetary Fund.
