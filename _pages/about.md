I'm a PhD candidate in economics at American University. I visited the University of Pennsylvania during Spring 2024. 

**I will be on the job market during the 2024-2025 academic year.**

My research interests are in macroeconomics and inequality topics. I have worked on projects studying the distributional effects of fiscal and monetary policies while visiting the Federal Reserve Board, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and International Monetary Fund.

"Racial Differences in the Marginal Propensity to Consume: New Survey Evidence and Theory" (2024) **_Job Market Paper_**

<summary>Abstract</summary> 
<br>
The racial wealth gap is large. An explanation for the persistence of this gap is that people spend their resources differently. Estimating consumption measures such as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) by race is crucial in understanding the wealth gap. I draw on unique survey data to estimate MPCs by race. Most of the racial difference in MPCs remains unexplained after empirically controlling for respondent characteristics such as demographics and income. I use a life-cycle model to explain these patterns and estimate that 30% of the racial difference in spending is explained by status compensation motives. In the model, all individuals with wealth want to signal their status by consuming goods that are visible to others. However, black consumers have more of a need to signal status to compensate for perceptions of them having lower incomes. Individuals that signal their status through consumption have fewer resources to accumulate wealth. Models that include racial heterogeneity in earnings volatility, unemployment shocks, and expenses, but exclude status motives, do not match the data showing that black people's spending on visible goods increases with wealth. I use my model to show how understanding status spending motives can be used to address the racial wealth gap by estimating the size of a new policy to eliminate racial differences in wealth.

"Monetary Policy Transmission to Consumption: Inequalities by Gender and Race" (2024)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
This paper finds evidence that contractionary monetary policy shocks raise consumption inequality by gender and race, along with raising unemployment and income inequality. Following a 25 basis point contractionary shock, spending on durable goods falls by 15% for households headed by black men while only 5% for households headed by white men. Additionally, spending on nondurable goods and services is decreased by 1.3% for households headed by black women, but by less than 1% for households headed by white men or women. Household characteristics such as composition or income do not explain differences in consumption responses. I also show that contractionary, rather than expansionary, shocks generally drive transmission inequalities.
